# Next-Tech-Reads
Personalised book recommendation system for a user. Similar to goodreads[https://www.goodreads.com/]

# Introduction 
Recommender systems provide users with personalised suggestions for product(Books). In this project, we build a book
recommender system based on several selected data sets, which estimates the book ratings, age, location, emotion
from each user.

# Model 
The model is predicting user book based recommendations based upon Age, Previous user rating, Location and Emotion. The Emotion are predicted by an LSTM given a sequence of words, determing it's sentimesnt and later on these emotions are used to recommend books to the particular user. 

# Recommendation system
The system uses the algorithms such as collaborative filtering, euclidian distances, K Nearest Neighbourhood, User similarity score and LSTM to predict output emotion for a given sequence of input of words.
